In the realm of code, we boldly tread,
Where bugs and logic dance, it's said.
With keys and screens, our canvas bright,
We craft with logic, day and night.

From JavaScript's embrace, we start,
With TypeScript's type, we play our part.
In React's virtual world, we spin,
And Next.js brings our dreams within.

Rust, so young, yet strong and bold,
In safety's arms, its story's told.
In my room breeze, we find our way,
To master fields, we code, night and day.
